# SLEEP-EFFICIENCY-MODELING
This project analyzes factors affecting sleep quality using wearable device data (450+ nights). Predictors include age, gender, sleep stages, caffeine/alcohol intake, and exercise. Four models were tested:

Random Forest (82% efficiency) outperformed others by capturing complex interactions.

KNN (79%) identified local patterns, Elastic Net (75%) balanced feature selection, and Linear Regression (68%) provided baseline insights.
Key findings: Sleep duration, awakenings, and exercise most impact efficiency; high caffeine/alcohol reduces it. Future steps include deep learning (RNNs/LSTMs) for temporal patterns and clinical integration for personalized sleep health solutions.
Impact: Enables data-driven strategies to improve sleep quality and address disorders. ðŸŒ™ðŸ“Š
