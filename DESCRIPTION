**Sleep Efficiency Modeling Project**  

### **Objective**  
To predict sleep efficiency (time asleep in bed) using demographic, sleep-stage, and lifestyle data to identify key factors affecting sleep quality.  

---

### **Dataset Overview**  
- **Source**: Kaggle (450+ nights of wearable device data).  
- **Key Variables**:  
  - **Demographic**: Age, Gender.  
  - **Sleep Metrics**: Duration, efficiency (%), REM/deep/light sleep percentages, awakenings.  
  - **Lifestyle**: Caffeine/alcohol intake (mg), smoking status, exercise frequency.  
- **EDA Insights**:  
  - Sleep efficiency peaks at 80-90% for most individuals.  
  - Negative correlation between caffeine consumption and efficiency.

### **Models Developed & Performance**  
1. **Linear Regression**  
   - **Efficiency**: 68%  
   - **Pros**: Simple, interpretable.  
   - **Cons**: Struggles with non-linear relationships (e.g., sleep stages).  

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
   - **Efficiency**: 79%  
   - **Pros**: Captures local patterns (e.g., age-specific sleep trends).  
   - **Cons**: Performance depends on optimal *k*-value selection.  

3. **Elastic Net Regression**  
   - **Efficiency**: 75%  
   - **Pros**: Balances L1/L2 regularization for feature selection.  
   - **Cons**: Underperformed due to correlated predictors (e.g., sleep stages).  

4. **Random Forest Regression**  
   - **Efficiency**: 82% (Best Performer)  
   - **Pros**: Handles non-linear interactions (e.g., caffeine + awakenings).  
   - **Cons**: Complex interpretation compared to linear models.  

---

### **Key Findings**  
- **Top Influencers**: Sleep duration, awakenings, and exercise frequency.  
- **Lifestyle Impact**: High caffeine/alcohol intake reduces efficiency by 10-15%.  
- **Model Superiority**: Random Forest excels in capturing multi-factor interactions (e.g., age + REM sleep).  

---

### **Future Work**  
- **Deep Learning**: Implement RNNs/LSTMs to analyze temporal sleep patterns.  
- **Personalized Models**: Tailor predictions to individual habits (e.g., night-shift workers).  
- **Clinical Tools**: Integrate models into telehealth platforms for sleep disorder diagnosis (e.g., insomnia, apnea).  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The project highlights machine learning‚Äôs role in sleep health analytics. Random Forest emerged as the most robust model, while future AI-driven approaches could enable personalized sleep optimization and clinical advancements.  

**Impact**: A step toward data-driven sleep medicine, empowering individuals and healthcare providers to improve sleep quality through actionable insights. üåôüîç
